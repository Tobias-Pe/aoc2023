# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2023 repository! üéÑ‚ú® This is where I'll be sharing my solutions and thoughts as I tackle the coding challenges throughout December.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles. Each day, a new challenge is unlocked, and the puzzles often involve a mix of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills. It's a great way to have fun, learn new things, and celebrate the holiday season with fellow coders around the world.

## Repository Structure

Here's a brief overview of the structure of this repository:

- **[Day X](dayX/):** Template for all days with file reader
- **[Day 1](day1/):** Code for day 1
- **[Day 2](day2/):** Code for day 2
- ... (continue this pattern for each day)

## Getting Started

If you want to explore my solutions or use this repository for your own learning:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tobias-Pe/aoc2023`
2. Navigate to the day you're interested in: `cd aoc2023/dayX`
3. Check out the solution code!

Feel free to use, modify, or share my code as you see fit. If you have improvements or suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

## Advent of Code 2023 Goals

This year, my goals are to:

- Complete each day's challenge within a reasonable time frame.
- Explore and implement efficient algorithms for optimization.
- Refresh my Golang Skills.

## Acknowledgments

A special thanks to the creators of Advent of Code and the community that makes this event so enjoyable!

Happy coding and may your solutions be bug-free! üöÄüéÅ
